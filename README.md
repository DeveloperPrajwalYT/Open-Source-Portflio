# 🛸 Vibe Portfolio

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Disclaimer:** I am a full-stack developer by trade and do **not** "vibe code" as my standard practice. This project was strictly a personal experiment to explore the boundaries of AI prompting, LLM-assisted architecture, and modern developer workflows. It’s a "yada yada" exploration into how far AI can push the UI/UX envelope under expert guidance.

**Live Demo:** [beamish-naiad-e856c9.netlify.app](https://beamish-naiad-e856c9.netlify.app/)

Welcome to my first **"vibe-coded"** project. As a full-stack developer, I wanted to experiment with a workflow focused on rapid iteration, aesthetic intuition, and AI-assisted design—without sacrificing the code quality expected of a seasoned dev.

This is a high-performance, open-source portfolio template featuring a deep level of customization, fluid motion, and a unique "vibe-centric" UI.

## 🧠 Why "Vibe Coded"?

While I have a deep background in traditional full-stack development, this project was an experiment in **Flow State Development**. It represents a shift from "writing every line from scratch" to "architecting via intent." 

> "Vibe coding isn't about being lazy; it's about being fast enough to keep up with your own creativity."

The result is a project that was built at the speed of thought but maintains the clean architecture and performance of a professional-grade site.
