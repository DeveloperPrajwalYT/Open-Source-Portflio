# 🛸 Vibe Portfolio

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Disclaimer:** I am a full-stack developer by trade. I do **not** "vibe code" as my standard practice. This project was strictly an experiment for me to learn AI prompting and "yada yada"—exploring how to bridge the gap between AI generation and professional-grade implementation.

**Live Demo:** [beamish-naiad-e856c9.netlify.app](https://beamish-naiad-e856c9.netlify.app/)

A high-performance, open-source portfolio template featuring fluid motion and a unique "vibe-centric" UI. This project proves that even an AI-assisted "vibe" workflow can result in clean, accessible, and stunning web experiences when guided by a developer who knows their stuff.

## 🧠 The "Vibe Coding" Experiment

While I usually spend my time in the depths of the full stack, this project was about testing the speed of **Intent-Based Development**. It represents a shift from writing every semicolon to architecting via high-level prompting. 

> "It's not just about the code; it's about how fast you can translate an aesthetic 'vibe' into a functional reality."
